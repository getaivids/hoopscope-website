# The Biomechanics of an Unshakeable Handle
**By Dr. Evelyn Reed. Date: September 18, 2025. Category: Analytics**

## The Science of Ball Control
We analyzed elite dribbling using motion capture and pressure basketballs. Body posture, stability, and finger pad control create elite handles.

### Stance & Physics
- Staying low lowers center of gravity, allows quicker, stable dribbles.

### Hand Mechanics
- Elite dribblers push, not slap, the ball.
- Palm for power, finger pads for control.

### Applied Science
- Every move = biomechanical feedback. Once trained, even complex moves are repeatable.
