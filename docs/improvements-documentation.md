## SEO & Metadata Enhancements

Added critical SEO elements to improve discoverability:

```html
<meta name="description" content="Hoopscope: Data-driven basketball training, analytics, and community platform for serious players.">
<meta name="keywords" content="basketball, analytics, training, player development, basketball data">
<meta name="author" content="Hoopscope Technologies">
```

These additions will help search engines better understand and index the website content.

## Accessibility Improvements

Several WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) improvements were implemented:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Added keyboard handling for modals (Escape key closes modals)
   - Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard accessible

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Added appropriate ARIA attributes to interactive elements
   - Added `aria-label` attributes to buttons without text content
   - Added `aria-modal` and `role="dialog"` to modal windows

3. **Focus Management**
   - Improved focus management for modal dialogs
   - Enhanced visual focus indicators

4. **Semantic HTML**
   - Used proper heading structure for better content hierarchy
   - Used semantic elements where appropriate (sections, nav, footer, etc.)

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Image Loading

Implemented lazy loading for images:

```javascript
function lazyLoadImages() {
    const images = document.querySelectorAll('img:not(.loaded)');
    images.forEach(img => {
        if (!img.classList.contains('lazy-load')) {
            img.classList.add('lazy-load');
        }
        
        const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
            entries.forEach(entry => {
                if (entry.isIntersecting) {
                    // Load image when it enters viewport
                    // ...
                }
            });
        });
        
        observer.observe(img);
    });
}
```

### Optimized Event Handling

- Replaced multiple event listeners with event delegation
- Added debouncing for performance-intensive operations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

Enhanced mobile experience with:

1. **Mobile Menu**
   - Implemented hamburger menu for mobile devices
   - Added smooth transitions for menu opening/closing

2. **Responsive Layout**
   - Improved grid layouts for different screen sizes
   - Fixed spacing issues on small screens
   - Enhanced touch targets for better mobile usability

3. **Media Queries**
   - Added specific styles for different breakpoints
   - Fixed font sizing issues on small devices

---

## API Integration Changes

### OpenAI API Integration

Replaced the empty Gemini API implementation with a proper OpenAI API integration:

```javascript
async function callOpenAIAPI(prompt, schema = null) {
    // In a production environment, this would be fetched from an environment variable
    const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || "YOUR_API_KEY"; 
    
    try {
        // Show loading indicator
        if (apiErrorMessage) apiErrorMessage.classList.add('hidden');
        
        // Prepare the request payload
        let requestBody = {
            model: "gpt-4-turbo",
            messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
            temperature: 0.7,
            max_tokens: 1000
        };
        
        // Add schema if provided
        if (schema) {
            requestBody.response_format = { type: "json_object" };
        }
        
        // API call implementation
        // ...
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error calling OpenAI API:", error);
        if (apiErrorMessage) apiErrorMessage.classList.remove('hidden');
        return null;
    }
}
```

### Security Improvements

- Removed hardcoded API keys, using environment variables instead
- Added proper error handling for API calls
- Implemented better user feedback during API operations

---

## JavaScript Functionality Enhancements

### Error Handling

Added robust error handling throughout:

```javascript
try {
    const plan = JSON.parse(resultText);
    // Process plan data
} catch (e) {
    console.error("Error parsing workout plan:", e);
    workoutPlanContent.innerHTML = `<p class="text-red-400">Could not generate the plan. The AI returned an unexpected format.</p>`;
}
```

### Enhanced User Feedback

Added loading indicators and error messages:

```html
<button id="generate-plan-btn" class="mt-4 w-full bg-orange-600 hover:bg-orange-700 text-white px-8 py-3 rounded-full font-semibold transition-colors text-lg flex items-center justify-center gap-2" aria-label="Generate workout plan">
    <span id="generate-btn-text">Generate Plan</span>
    <div id="generate-loader" class="w-5 h-5 rounded-full loader hidden"></div>
</button>
<p id="api-error-message" class="mt-2 text-red-400 text-sm hidden">An error occurred. Please try again later.</p>
```
